Here, you thank everyone directly and indirectly responsible for your academic life. For the most part, no one will read this page, and it approaches wall of text status. Feel free to pepper in absurdity. Some examples:

\begin{enumerate}
\item ``I'd also like to thank Adderall, for being a near inexhaustible source of motivation, at mere cost of my sanity.``
\item ``Pandoc, for allowing me to pretend that, after finishing my dissertation, I can easily turn everything into a monograph.``
\end{enumerate}
