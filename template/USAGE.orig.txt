1. General Notes

  (a) All LaTeX commands (e.g., \abstractpage) listed in this template must be
        included as written (exception: \abstractmultiplepage may be commented out
        if the abstract occupies only the first page)

  (b) For appendix chapters, you have to use the command appchapter{} instead
        of chapter{} due to a page-numbering difference.

  (c) The only way that consistent margins may be expected is for the compile/print
       process to replicate what was used during the template's creation (Deviating
       from these steps may cause unexpected and unsatisfactory results!):

       (1) Compile the LaTeX file/project as usual to create the .dvi file

       (2) Use dvi2pdf to convert the .dvi file to .pdf (Using the WinEdt™ file
            editor, this is accomplished by using the "dvi -> pdf" button.)

       (3) Print the pdf from Adobe reader BUT in the print dialogue window, make
            sure that "Page Scaling" is set to "none" and the "Auto-Rotate and
            Center" field is left unchecked.

2. Abstract

    Currently, the template file (GMU_dissertation_template.tex) includes on line 139 the
    optional command "\abstractmultiplepage" to create a second page for the abstract.
    It has become clear, however, that if this option is not selected, the page numbering
    scheme is disrupted.  Specifically, in the Table of Contents, the page number is listed
    as "0" instead of the appropriate Roman numeral (usually "viii").

    A permanent solution for this problem is forthcoming, and this problem is rightly
    referred to as a "known issue."  As currently coded, therefore, it is *strongly*
    recommended that the abstract extend to the second page, if at all possible.
    (I would suspect that the abstract would occupy both pages in the majority of
    dissertations anyhow.)

3. Figures and Tables

  (a) GMU dissertation guidelines mandate that figures and tables be separated from
        the narrative text by a few line spaces.  By default, LaTeX won't add enough
        space after figures and tables, so such space needs to be added manually for
        each figure.  This can be done by adding the command \figSpace after the
        caption for figures:

        \begin{figure}
            \centering
            \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{figGeorgeMason}\\
            \caption{An appropriate historical figure}

            % This adds separation space between this figure and either another
            %   figure, or between the figure and the text.
            \figSpace
        \end{figure}

        or the command \tableSpace after the tabular environment for a table:

        \begin{table}
            \centering
            \caption{Another table}
            % Tabular environment goes AFTER the caption!
            \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
            % after \\: \hline or \cline{col1-col2} \cline{col3-col4} ...
            \hline
            1 & 2 & 3 \\\hline
            4 & 5 & 6 \\\hline
            7 & 8 & 9 \\
            \hline
            \end{tabular}

            % This adds separation space between this table and either another
            %   table, or between the table and the text.
            \tableSpace
        \end{table}

        Currently, \figSpace and \tableSpace are set in both set to a 0.3"
        vertical skip in gmudissertation.sty but could be changed in principle.

  (b) Figures (or tables) that appear on a page without any narrative text would
        tend to be centered on the page by LaTeX.  However, the GMU style insists
        that such figures be forced to the top of their page.  The student should
        thus look carefully at the compiled document and identify any such cases.
        Then, for each case, the optional argument [!t] needs to be added to the
        \begin{figure} (or \begin{table}) command as follows:

        \begin{figure}[!t]

            ... (FIGURE CODE) ...

        \end{figure}

        This should force the picture to the top of the page.  (I say "should" since
        I have found cases in which this does not work properly; this method should
        still represent the first attempt at fixing the problem, however.)
